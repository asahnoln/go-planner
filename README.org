#+TITLE: About this package

* What is it?
Package planner is designed for creating dynamic time tables.

You plan a project, an event or a meeting, which consists of subprocesses. For example: introduce yourself, introduce the project, describe the problem etc. You know how much time each subprocess should take, but you don't time it - you check against the clock. So that introduction should go from 12:00 till 12:05, then project description should go from 12:05 till 12:15 etc.

It's a pain to calculate those time ranges in your head. That's why I produced this package, so that you can plan events and in the result have a dynamic timetable of each subprocess of the event.
